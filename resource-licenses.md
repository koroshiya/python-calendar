This project itself (specifically the code) is licensed under MIT, but the individual resources vary.<br>
<br>
Within the pygame folder there is an included font (Ubuntu-M.ttf) with its own license (ubuntu-font-licence-1.0.txt). The font is currently in use, but can be removed very easily if you do not wish to include the font and its license.<br>
<br>
The gray.svg, onyx.svg and refinery.png files are all public domain image files. <br>
You can use them freely anywhere for anything, commercial or free, without restriction.<br>
The same applies to the gray.png and onyx.png files within the renpy directory.<br>
All of the above image files (except gray.svg) have been modified and are thus technically derivative works, but I am releasing them back into the public domain anyway.<br>
<br>
HomeStreet_01.png is a photo I took myself and then filtered/resized. As with the others, I'm licensing it under the public domain.<br>
